# LLM Enhancement Implementation Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Identified
The LLM conflict resolution system was generating resolutions that consistently failed verification due to:
- Insufficient heading changes (< 15Â°)
- Not accounting for lookahead time
- Ignoring geometric constraints
- Verifier-prompt mismatch

## âœ… Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Prompt Engineering
- **Explicit Geometric Constraints**: Added minimum thresholds (20Â° heading, 1000ft altitude, 20kt speed)
- **Pre-calculated Safe Zones**: System now calculates forbidden zones and provides safe heading options
- **Conflict-specific Guidance**: Prompts include closure rate, time to CPA, and bearing analysis

### 2. Sanitization Pipeline
- **Auto-correction**: Automatically increases insufficient changes to meet minimums
- **Range Validation**: Ensures headings (0-360Â°), altitudes (1000-45000ft), speeds (250-490kt)
- **Geometric Validation**: Checks heading changes avoid collision courses

### 3. Enhanced Verification
- **Explicit Validation Logic**: Verifier now has clear mathematical criteria
- **Detailed Feedback**: Specific geometric violations with examples
- **Re-prompt Mechanism**: Failed resolutions trigger feedback-enhanced re-prompting

### 4. Agreement-of-Two System
- **Consensus Validation**: Generates two independent resolutions with different seeds
- **Agreement Checking**: Validates maneuver type and parameter consistency
- **Quality Assurance**: Reduces random LLM variation effects

### 5. Configuration Improvements
- **Lower Temperature**: 0.2 for more consistent outputs
- **Enhanced Telemetry**: Tracks schema violations, verifier failures, agreement mismatches
- **Fail-safe Mechanisms**: Robust fallback with geometric guarantees

## ðŸ”§ Key Code Changes

### Enhanced Prompt Template (llm_client.py)
```
CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS (Must satisfy ALL):
- Minimum heading change: Â±20Â° (ENFORCED)
- AVOID headings within Â±15Â° of intruder bearing
- Pre-calculated safe zones provided
```

### Sanitizer Function
```python
def _sanitize_resolution(self, resolution, context):
    # Auto-correct insufficient changes
    # Enforce minimum thresholds
    # Validate geometric constraints
```

### Re-prompt with Feedback
```python
def _reprompt_with_feedback(self, context, violations):
    # Include specific violation feedback
    # Enhanced constraints based on failures
    # Second chance with corrected guidance
```

## ðŸ“Š Expected Improvements

1. **Higher Success Rate**: Resolutions should pass verification more frequently
2. **Better Geometry**: Heading changes that actually achieve separation
3. **Reduced Fallbacks**: Fewer cases requiring default resolutions
4. **Faster Convergence**: Less LLM back-and-forth due to better prompts
5. **Audit Trail**: Complete telemetry for debugging and optimization

## ðŸ§ª Testing Results
- âœ… Enhanced prompts with geometric pre-calculation
- âœ… Sanitization auto-corrects insufficient changes  
- âœ… Verifier provides specific mathematical feedback
- âœ… Re-prompt mechanism attempts recovery
- âœ… Fallback provides geometrically valid resolutions

## ðŸš€ Next Steps for E2E Testing
Run the enhanced system in the full pipeline:
```bash
python -m src.cdr.cli run-e2e --scat-path data/sample_scat.json --output-dir output/enhanced_test
```

The system should now generate more reliable, geometrically valid conflict resolutions that pass the strict verification requirements.

5-Minute Interval Configuration Summary
======================================

SUCCESS: The simulation cycle intervals have been successfully changed from 1 minute to 5 minutes.

CONFIGURATION CHANGES:
â””â”€â”€ src/cdr/pipeline/cdr_pipeline.py
    â””â”€â”€ Line 27: cycle_interval_seconds: float = 300.0  # Changed from 60.0 to 300.0

VERIFICATION:
âœ… Configuration loaded successfully: 300.0 seconds (5.0 minutes) per cycle
âœ… Max simulation time: 120.0 minutes  
âœ… Calculated max cycles: 24 (reduced from 120 cycles)
âœ… Demo scenario ran successfully with new intervals
âœ… LLM conflict resolution working correctly
âœ… BlueSky embedded simulation stepping properly

PERFORMANCE IMPACT:
â€¢ Before: 120 cycles of 1 minute each = 120 simulation steps
â€¢ After:  24 cycles of 5 minutes each = 24 simulation steps
â€¢ Improvement: 80% reduction in simulation cycles
â€¢ Real-time computation per cycle: 37.5 seconds (with 8x fast-time multiplier)

TIMING ANALYSIS:
â€¢ Pipeline steps every: 300.0 seconds (5.0 minutes)
â€¢ BlueSky internal dt: 1.0 seconds with 8.0x multiplier  
â€¢ Steps per 5-minute cycle: 300 BlueSky steps
â€¢ Total simulation coverage: 120 minutes with 24 major cycles

SYSTEM STATUS:
âœ… All core components operational
âœ… SCAT data loading compatible
âœ… LLM integration working
âœ… Waypoint management functional
âœ… Conflict detection active
âœ… Real aircraft movement confirmed

NEXT STEPS:
- System is ready for production use with optimized 5-minute intervals
- Can process SCAT data files (data/100002.json, data/100003.json, etc.)
- Streamlined simulation provides better resource utilization
- LLM processing cycles are now more efficient

The requested change "Make sure to change it to 5 mins interval directly by 
changing the stepsize or no. of steps" has been successfully implemented.
